Master Thesis: Deep Learning-Based Sequence Models for Music Generation

Project Description:

1. Motivation: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the ability to generate high-quality music with long-range dependencies, thanks to innovative architectures like xLSTM and Mamba. These models have addressed the quadratic scaling issues seen in Transformer models, enabling more efficient long-context music generation. Despite these technical breakthroughs, current state-of-the-art AI music generation models, such as those from Suno.com and OpenAI’s Jukebox, primarily offer minimal user control, operating as fully automated systems. This thesis is motivated by the need for next-generation music production tools that integrate greater creative control, aiming to complement rather than replace the creative processes of musicians and producers. By exploring methodologies for conditional generation and human-guided refinement, this research seeks to bridge the gap between AI-driven automation and human creativity, aligning with the ongoing investments of major tech companies in digital composition.

2. Prior Work: The evolution of sequence modeling and AI-driven music generation has been marked by significant contributions, particularly the introduction of the Transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. and its subsequent application to music generation via projects like Google’s Music Transformer. Despite its success, the Transformer's quadratic-scaling presents challenges for long-form music generation. Recent advancements, such as Mamba's linear-time complexity and xLSTM's enhancements for temporal dependencies, show promise in overcoming these limitations. Notably, the dual-feature modeling approach in MusicMamba highlights hybrid architecture’s potential in creating stylistically accurate and genre-specific adaptations. These advancements mark a paradigm shift towards more scalable, efficient, and musically coherent AI-driven music generation.

3. Research Questions:

What are effective symbolic encodings of MIDI data for polyphonic music, and how do Mamba, xLSTM, and Transformer models trained on these encodings compare in terms of generative quality, computational efficiency, and ability to model long-range dependencies?
Which conditioning mechanisms are most effective for controlling music generation with Mamba and xLSTM models, and how do these mechanisms affect the diversity and quality of the generated output?
What combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative user studies can effectively evaluate the performance of Mamba and xLSTM models in generating polyphonic music and the effectiveness of conditional generation techniques?
4. Learning Objectives:

Analyze technical challenges in AI music generation, including model scalability and long-range dependencies, and their impact on output quality and musicality.
Apply current AI research on sequence modeling and conditional generation to enhance music generation systems.
Develop AI-driven music generation models, optimize symbolic MIDI encoding, integrate conditional generation for user control, and create an evaluation framework.
Communicate research findings effectively both orally and in writing, incorporating leading international research in AI and music generation.
Undertake independent research and reflect on learning, demonstrating the ability to manage cross-disciplinary collaboration in AI, data science, music theory, and real-world musician interaction.
5. Plan: Goals:

Goal 1: Make symbolic musical encoding for polyphonic MIDI data.
Goal 2: Implement Transformer, Mamba, and xLSTM architectures for sequence generation.
Goal 3: Add conditional generation to models.
Goal 4: Set up a metadata classifier.
Goal 5: Train models on HPC.
Goal 6: Perform qualitative and quantitative testing on models and generated music.
A Gantt Chart will guide the timeline, with writing and documentation occurring alongside project development, allowing for ongoing reflections and adjustments based on practical findings and feedback.
